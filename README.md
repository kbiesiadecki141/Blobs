Concept
* Use your magic compass to guide you in the darkness to attack BLOBS.
* Click to shoot as many BLOBS as possible.
* When BLOBS come too close, they attack you -- so keep an eye on your health!

Setup
* Clone this repo.
* Install Processing: https://processing.org/download/
* Plug Magic Compass into your computer.
    * You may have to check your Serial Port to properly communicate with the Arduino.
* Open the repo in Processing and run the app.

How I Made It

* Sprites made in Piskel: piskelapp.com/p/create
* Magic Compass is just a servo with a laser cut circle attachment.
    * Powered by Arduino, using the Examples > Firmata > ServoFirmata sketch
